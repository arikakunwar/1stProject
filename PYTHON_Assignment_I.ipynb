On Unix, they can also be run as executables with the #! trick, and some platforms support more specialized launching techniques (e.g., drag and drop). In addition, some text editors have unique ways to run Python code, some Python programs are provided as standalone “frozen binary” executables, and some systems use Python code in embedded mode, where it is run automatically by an enclosing program written in a language like C, C++, or Java. The latter technique is usually done to provide a user customization layer.\r\n",

        "  \r\n",
        "  Python imports (loads) a module only once per process, by default, so if you’ve changed its source code and want to run the new version without stopping and restarting Python, you’ll have to reload it. You must import a module at least once before you can reload it. Running files of code from a system shell command line,via an icon click, or via an IDE such as IDLE generally makes this a nonissue.\r\n",

Also,IDLE has some usability features that can burn you once you leave the IDLE GUI a script’s variables are automatically imported to the interactive scope in IDLE and working directories are changed when you run a file, for instance, but Python itself does not take such steps in general.\r\n",

        "  A namespace is just a package of variables (i.e., names). It takes the form of an object with attributes in Python. Each module file is automatically a namespace—that is, a package of variables reflecting the assignments made at the top level of the file. Namespaces help avoid name collisions in Python programs: because each module file is a self-contained namespace, files must explicitly import other files in order to use their names.\r\n",
